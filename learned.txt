====== Identifying Divisions & Spans ======

Divisions, or <div>s, and <span>s are HTML elements that act as containers solely for styling purposes. As generic containers, they do not come with any overarching meaning or semantic value. Paragraphs are semantic in that content wrapped within a <p> element is known and understood as a paragraph. <div>s and <span>s do not hold any such meaning and are simply containers.

* <div> is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content
* helps to build a web page’s layout and design
* If content is being grouped solely for styling purposes and doesn’t provide value to the outline of a document, use the <div> element

* <span> is an inline-level element commonly used to identify smaller groupings of text within a block-level element.

====== Block vs. Inline Elements ======

* Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width
* Block-level elements may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements
* most commonly block-level elements are used for larger pieces of content, such as paragraphs.
<p>

* Inline-level elements do not begin on a new line, they fall into the normal flow of a document, lining up one after the other
* only maintain the width of their content
* Inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot wrap block-level elements
* inline-level elements are used with smaller pieces of content, such as a few words
<strong>

====== Styling ======

* We want to choose a value that refers to the content of an element, not necessarily the appearance of an element

====== Headings ======

* Headings are block-level elements
* They help search engines to index and determine the content on a page

===== Bold Text with Strong ======

* To make text bold and place a strong importance on it, we’ll use the <strong> inline-level element
* two elements that will bold text for us: the <strong> and <b> elements

* The <strong> element is semantically used to give strong importance to text
* The <b> element semantically means to stylistically offset text
* We have to gauge the significance of the text we wish to set as bold and to choose an element accordingly.

===== Italicize Text with Emphasis ======

* placing emphasis on it, we’ll use the <em> inline-level element
* The <em> element is used semantically to place a stressed emphasis on text
* the <i> element, is used semantically to convey text in an alternative voice or tone, almost as if it were placed in quotation marks.

====== Building Structure =======

* Fortunately HTML5 introduced new structurally based elements, including the <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> elements.
* are intended to give meaning to the organization and improve our structural semantics
* they are all block-level elements and do not have any implied position or style

====== Header ======

* the <header> element may include a heading, introduction text, and even navigation

===== Navigation ======

* The <nav> element identifies a section of major navigational links on a page
* should be reserved for primary navigation sections only
* such as global navigation, a table of contents, previous/next links, or other noteworthy groups of navigational links

===== Article =====

* <article> element is used to identify a section of independent, self-contained content that may be independently distributed or reused
* to mark up blog posts, newspaper articles, user-submitted content, and the like
* contribute to a document’s structure and help to outline a document
* content adds to the document outline and it can be independently redistributed or syndicated

====== Section ======

* <section> element is used to identify a thematic grouping of content
* generally, but not always, includes a heading
* contribute to a document’s structure and help to outline a document
* content adds to the document outline and represents a thematic group of content

===== Aside ======

* holds content, such as sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations, that is tangentially related to the content surrounding it
* all of the structural elements, including the <aside> element, are block-level elements and as such will appear on a new line, occupying the full available width of the page
* or of the element they are nested within, also known as their parent element

===== Footer =====

* identifies the closing or end of a page, article, section, or other segment of a page
* Content within the <footer> element should be relative information and should not diverge from the document or section it is included within
